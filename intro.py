"""The Return of the Dark Dragon Lord

In the realm of _______ there once was a baby dragon.
Its name was Maylanth he also had a brother named Syrilth.
Years and years went by and Syrilth was always treated better
then Maylanth. Every single year Maylanth grew worse and worse,
one day when his family was sleeping he snuck away to a cave.
In the cave he found that there was a purple gem so he took it
thinking that it was good luck. He fell asleep while he was asleep Syrilth found him.
Maylanth woke up to find that his brother took his gem and smashed it. He grew evil inside.
A long time passed and Maylanth became the dragon Lord of Evil, and his brother Syrilth became the 
dragon Lord of Good
